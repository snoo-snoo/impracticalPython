# Chapter 01: Silly Name Generator

## The Objective
Randomly generate funny sidekick names unsing Python code that conforms to established style guidelines.

## 1. Planning
### Strategy
There will be two lists: 
- First names
- Surnames

I will be using a tuple() for both of them, since they will be static and I wont change them.

After that we generate a name as a combination of a first name and a surname randomly.
This name should be an console output. 

### Pseudocode

```
Load a list of first names
Load a list of surnames 
Choose a first name at random
Assign that name to a variable
Choose a surname at random
Assign that name to a variable
Print the sname to the screen in order and in red font
Ask the user to quit or play again
if user plays again:
    repeat
if user quits:
    end and exit
```
